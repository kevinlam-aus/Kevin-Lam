## Hi there, I'm Kevin <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="25">

I'm a data engineer and an aspiring data analyst. I mainly write code with Python and SQL, but have dabbled in other langueages.

In college I had an internship as a data analyst as at a social networking app. There I was able to visualize networks and was tasked with attemping to explain what made a specific user popular. With a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Management Information Systems and a minor in Marketing, I bring a unique blend of technical and business acumen to data. 

After being a Data Engineer, I realized that though backend engineering exciting, my true passion is leveraging data to drive business decisions and am working to transition into a data analyst role.


  
## Main projects

### Predicting if an employee would leave Salifort Motors
**Code:** [`Analyzing turnover at Salifort.ipynb`]([https://github.com/tiannaparris/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/Analyzing%20the%20Factors%20Contributing%20to%20the%20Success%20of%20a%20Movie.ipynb](https://github.com/kevinlam-aus/Portfolio-Projects/blob/main/Salifort%20Motors%20Capstone%20Project.ipynb))

**Goal:** To determine why there was such a high turnover rate at Salifort Motors.

**Description:** The project focused on analyzing a dataset of employees collected by the HR team. The dataset included satifaction level, employee's last performance review, number of projects an employee contributes to, number of hours an employee works a month, employee tenure, whether they were promoted in the last 5 years, and other relevant information. The project involved loading the data, cleaning and preprocessing it, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), analyzing the correlation between whetehr an employee left or not against other variables, and builing logistical and tree-based models.

**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, data modeling, machine learning, data visualization.

**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Sklearn.

**Results:** Using Python functions the analysis revealed that there is cause for concern about a data leakage. However, with the data provided, it was found that the two variables with the highest importance that the model would use to predict if an employee was leaving was their last evaluation score and the number of hours the employee worked. Other factors also included their tenure and if the employee worked over 166.67 hours a month.
