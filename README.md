## Hi there, I'm Kevin <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="25">

I'm a data engineer and an aspiring data analyst. I mainly write code with Python and SQL, but have dabbled in other langueages.

In college I had an internship as a data analyst as at a social networking app. There I was able to visualize networks and was tasked with attemping to explain what made a specific user popular. With a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Management Information Systems and a minor in Marketing, I bring a unique blend of technical and business acumen to data. 

After being a Data Engineer, I realized that though backend engineering exciting, my true passion is leveraging data to drive business decisions and am working to transition into a Data Analyst role.
